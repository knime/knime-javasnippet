		 Applies user-defined business rules to the input table
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node takes a list of user-defined rules and tries to match them
			to each row in the input table. If a rule matches, its outcome value
			is added into a new column.
			The first matching rule in order of definition determines the outcome.
			<p>
				Each rule is represented by a line.
				To add comments, start a line with
				<tt>//</tt>
				(comments can not be placed in the same line as a rule). Anything after <tt>//</tt> will not be interpreted as a rule.
				Rules consist of a condition part (antecedent), which must
				evaluate to
				<i>true</i>
				or
				<i>false</i>
				, and an outcome (consequent, after the =&gt; symbol) which is put into
				the new column if the rule matches.
			</p>
			<p>The outcome of a rule may be any of the following: a string (between <tt>"</tt> or <tt>/</tt>), a number, a boolean constant, a reference
                to another column or the value of a flow variable value.
				The type of the outcome column is the common super
				type of all possible
				outcomes (including the rules that can never
				match).
				If no rule matches, the outcome is a missing value.
			</p>
			<p>
				Columns are given by their name surrounded by $, numbers are given
				in the usual decimal representation. Note that strings must not
				contain (double-)quotes. Flow variables are represented by
				<b>$${</b>
				TypeCharacterAndFlowVarName
				<b>}$$</b>
				.
				The TypeCharacter should be 'D' for double (real) values, 'I' for
				integer values and 'S' for strings.
                You can insert column names or flow variables by hand or by clicking in the respective lists in the
                dialog.
			</p>
            <p>The logical expressions can be grouped with parentheses. The
                precedence rules for them are the following: <tt>NOT</tt> binds most, <tt>AND</tt>,
                <tt>XOR</tt> and finally <tt>OR</tt> the least.
                Comparison operators always take
                precedence over logical connectives.
                All operators (and their names)
                are case-sensitive.
            </p>
			<p>
				The
				<tt>ROWID</tt>
				represents the row key string, the
				<tt>ROWINDEX</tt>
				is a the index of the row (first row has
				<tt>0</tt>
				value), while
				<tt>ROWCOUNT</tt>
				stands for the number of rows in the table.
			</p>
			<p>Some example rules (each should be in one line):</p>
			<pre>
// This is a comment
$Col0$ > 0 => "Positive"
</pre>
			When the values in Col0 are greater than 0, we assign Positive to the
			result column value (if no previous rule matched).
			<pre>
$Col0$ = "Active" AND $Col1$ &lt;= 5 => "Outlier"
</pre>
			You can combine conditions.
			<pre>
$Col0$ LIKE "Market Street*" AND 
    ($Col1$ IN ("married", "divorced") 
        OR $Col2$ > 40) => "Strange"
$Col0$ MATCHES $${SFlowVar0}$$ OR $$ROWINDEX$$ &lt; $${IFlowVar1}$$ =>
    $Col0$
</pre>
			With parentheses you can combine multiple conditions. The result in
			the second case comes from one of the columns.
			<pre>
$Col0$ > 5 => $${SCol1}$$
</pre>
			The result can also come from a flow variable.
			<p>
				You can use either Ctrl+Space to insert predefined parts, or
				select them from the upper controls.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			The following comparisons result true
			(other values are neither less, nor greater or equal to missing and NaN values):
			<ul>
			<li><b>?</b> =,&lt;=,&gt;= <b>?</b></li>
			<li><b>NaN</b> =,&lt;=,&gt;= <b>NaN</b></li>
			</ul>
